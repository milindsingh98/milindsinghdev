                Abstract-The IoT came with the advancement in many products and services from the
                primitive services like plumbing, carpeting to the high-end services like the website
                development and applications. The print process still remains the same. The optimized
                printing process is required to save time, money and wastage of paper. The printing
                job can be given by the Mobile phones with all the formatting required by the user.
                Through global positioning the nearest printing station is searched and the job
                is scheduled with the expected time of arrival for the user to collect the document.
                The online payment options and the pre-defined formatting is the thing that makes
                it ease for usage. The arrival time and the distance is calculated by the mobile
                devices to facilitate the user. Keywords-optimized printing, printing, print servers,

                I. INTRODUCTION Despite the numerous efforts of being completely paperless, there
                are still some places and works in which use of paper is needed. The regulated use
                of paper should be our first step towards going paperless. In this paper we implement
                an IoT based printing process in which the user can print the documents through
                their phone selecting the nearest printer hub given the GPS [1] and the printer
                hub in return gives the user the estimated arrival time of the user when the print
                work is done. The android application eases the use of the interface from which
                the actions are carried on. The printing process has seen a evolution from dot matrix
                printer to ink jet printers to modern laser jet printers. The services of the printers
                still remain the same. The people still prefer to get the documents printed by the
                local print centre because of the following factors. The operation and maintenance
                of the printers is still costly and high maintenance along with the refill cartridges.
                These factors lead to user still following up to the print centres. The print centre
                can be any local shop which provides printing and photocopy services. The Standard
                of work done is not always the kind of what we want but we have to negotiate with
                the quality and demands because of the rush at these centres. The printing charges
                when considered varies from place to place. There are not only the problems on the
                customer side there are problems faced by the service providers also. They find
                it difficult to calculate the total amount when there are different kind of paper
                and different printing methods. The different files when printed then page count
                gets misnumbered and they have to suffer a loss. The wastage of pages happens when
                the user demands something which is not fulfilled by them. The printer maintenance
                [5] also sums up more because of the overusage of the printers. The toner of the
                printer because of the over usage needs maintenance too frequently. This is why
                a platform is needed to optimize this task and problems.</p>
            <p>
                <br />
                II. SERVICE PROVIDED We provide many services to the client. We provide a numerous
                service to the user: - 1. We provide flexible time slot to the user as they can
                have their output at their time. 2. We provide easy payment options to the user.
                3. We provide the user a fast track option so the user can get print immediately.
                4. Our app also recommends the shop which is nearest and with least time to complete
                work. By using our application, the data which is uploaded on the print server then
                we recommend the user the nearest [2] shop and the shop which take least time for
                the work to be completed. Now after the shop is confirmed a payment option comes,
                we can pay via cash when we get the documents back or we have various payment gateway
                which provide the user for pre-payment. After we have selected everything, we click
                on the get print option then the document is sent to the shop and we can get our
                service at the chosen time slot and go to the shop to get our product delivered.
                Through this system we provide a platform which deals with the problems faced on
                the domestic and educational purposes. It will directly connect to the printer and
                the user can upload the files and set it according to the needs like font, colour,
                margin etc. It also solves the issue for managing the transactions for the printer
                centre manager and the user pays for what he/she prints. As it locates all the available
                print centre nearby [3] to the user location and also the waiting time for the job
                to be done so we see a more convenient and more optimised way of doing work. By
                providing the option for the user to schedule the print or fast-forward it, we are
                easily able to make things fast and work efficient with less hassles like waiting
                in a queue or standing for our work to be done now we will go to the shop only when
                our task is completed and the user will collect the printed papers from the centre
                by themselves. And by providing the option to pay through the app or pay on collection
                of the printed papers the payments are also easy and more convenient for the user.
            </p>
            <br />
            III. PROPOSED SYSTEM The proposed system for the model includes modules as mentioned
            in Fig.1. The proposed system can be divided into 4 sub-partitions. They can be
             Mobile Application  Print server  Print status and confirmation  Print hub
            end The Mobile application is the user interface with which the user end. Here,
            the user can upload the documents they want to get printed along with the pre-requisite
            conditions like the font, margin, fontcolour, font size etc. The user can only upload
            the permitted file formats on the application which are .pptx, .docx, .doc, .pdf,
            jpeg, .png etc. The documents need to be unlocked in case the document is locked
            because the locked document can’t be printed. After the user uploads the file and
            enter all the requests, the file is uploaded onto the print server. The Print server
            stores the documents temporarily till the user selects which print hub they want
            to print the document to. The Print server gives user an option of selecting the
            print centres according to the distance of commute and the Estimated printing time
            [5]. It shows the estimated arrival time for the job completion which can be called
            the sum of the commute distance and the print job time.
            <br />
            <br />
            𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 = 𝑇𝐼𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑢𝑡𝑒 + 𝑡ℎ𝑒
            𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒
            <br />
            <br />
            The different modules and steps followed The estimated arrival time [7] is variable
            to the commute time and the printing time. Consider in the case of traffic congestion
            in the area then the Estimated time will increase by the factor of which the congestion
            of traffic. The traffic data will be accessed through the Google Maps real time
            and it will refresh in every 5 minutes. The print job is variable for the conditions
            of the breakdown of the printer or the electricity supply crisis. The following
            factors will be looked upon and used for calculating the close approximation of
            the arrival time. After selection of the print centre the document is forwarded
            to the user selected print centre and the real time print status and the arrival
            time is shown to the user. Print Status[6] is given to the user in real time by
            mentioning the queue number to which the job is being assigned to the user. The
            estimated time will also be shown to the user along with the complete address of
            the print centre. The print status will show the estimated time calculated by the
            print server and the commute time between the user and the print hub. Print hub
            is the destination where the actual printing work will take place, the requirements
            of the user are considered here and the operations are queued up in FCFS (First
            Come First Serve) [5] with no pre-emption. Each job is considered at the most priority
            and the confidentiality of the user and user document is followed. The file after
            the print job is done is deleted from the hub and the hub sends message to the user
            about the printing process been complete. Fig. 2 includes the process flow model
            of the architecture through which the files and process pass from the customer to
            the print-end. The user gets the print status throughout the printing process and
            the process gets terminated with the success message when the job is complete. It
            includes the different process states starting from the user application where the
            user uploads the file and gives the requirement to be fulfilled. The user then can
            select the print hub according to their ease. The file is then shared with the print
            hub through google cloud along with the pre-set parameters and the estimated waiting
            time is calculated and the user can get the print status in real time. The file
            is arranged in the queue data structure at the print hub and FCFS is followed. The
            feedback loop consists of the print status which retrieves the waiting time to the
            user.
            <br />
            <p>
                IV. FUTURE SCOPE For future scope the application can be updated as: - 1. Using
                recycled papers for printing process for making it eco-friendly. 2. Customizing
                the proposed model into ATM like machines for printing through scanning the QR codes
                of the printing or scheduling through application. 3. Using priority queue for the
                urgent needs of the user for better services. 4. Widening the print services provided
                by the proposed system. 5. We can add home delivery[3] feature of the printed documents.
                6. A feature for adding more security so that the application is more secured and
                the uploaded data is not. 7. To decrease the waiting time by optimised algorithm.
                8. We can also provide discounts and coupon for bulk orders and cash back on various
                payment options.</p>
            <br />
            <pr>VI. CONCLUSION <br />The paper represents an android application
            which is used to have a optimised printing method for efficient and fast printing
            methods which helps in saving time reducing paper wastage and many more. The main
            aim of the project is overcoming the drawbacks of using the traditional printing
            methods so that one can experience an overall enhanced way of getting the printed
            material fast and hassle free. The application provides flexible time slot to the
            user can have their output at their time, provides easy payment options to the user,
            provides the user a fast track option so the user can get print immediately. And
            also recommends the shop which is nearest and with least time to complete work.
            By reducing all the efforts which we face in our day to day life for either standing
            in a queue or not getting the desired output which we want or struggling through
            not getting the right format or the way we did it or wants to be done due change
            in the application software version also wasting paper at a large scale because
            of above issues and many we have completely optimised the way of getting a fast
            and more efficient way of getting print so that we can save our time and get more
            efficient result. </pr>

                    Abstract—The waste management in India has not changed a lot in past decades. The
                    collection bins, collection method and disposal have been quite same. This paper
                    proposes a system which gives a new design, placement of garbage bins. The connection
                    and communication of all the bins to the base station. The location of the dustbins
                    are kept stationary and all the location are stored at the base center along with
                    the unique bin ID’s. The transceivers are placed on every dustbin which transmits
                    the signal to the base station which indicated whether the dustbin is full or not.
                    The routing algorithms are used to find the shortest path which connects to all
                    the dustbins. The collection trucks follows the optimized route for facilitation
                    and it saves fuel , brings accordance to the system.

                    I. INTRODUCTION
                    <br />
                    The Garbage collection bins which are used by the municipal corporation often comes
                    in the same pattern. Since couple of decades there has been talks about the efficient
                    garbage management and disposal but the garbage collection bins have not changed
                    much in the year. The structure has been the same in the years. There have been
                    garbage collection[4] trucks with the fork lifters to reduce the manual work. The
                    problem which still is stagnant in India is not the garbage but the garbage bins
                    and the sizes which they come in. We all have noticed the spillage of garbage outside
                    of the bins. The question arises who is responsible for it? In this paper we mention
                    the improvised design of the dustbins and how they can be made more efficient. To
                    find the answers to the question “Why do people still litter garbage outside dustbin
                    rather than putting in the bins?” There were a lot of answers I got from the people
                    that I would like to mention in this paper. • The height of the dustbins that makes
                    people vulnerable to throwing heavy garbage bags into the bins. • The typical smell
                    that comes from the dustbins. • The overflowing bins which make them to throw the
                    garbage nearby. • In rains the dustbins are filled with water and there is no space
                    left for the garbage. • There is no optimized path on which the collection truck
                    collects and moreover the base station does not know whether and when the dustbins
                    are full.<br />

                    <br />
                    • The proposed system has a different and more efficient material used for the dustbin
                    design.<br />
                    • It takes care of which dustbin is full and needs to be emptied thus not allowing
                    waste to litter around the dustbin.
                    <br />
                    • It solves the problem of foul smell spreading from the bins.
                    <br />
                    • Waste doesn't gets stuck to the dustbin walls making it easier while emptying
                    them.
                    <br />
                    • It reduces the number of flies breeding over the bins.<br />
                    • Clogging of water does not occur due to the rubber stoppers.
                    <br />
                    • The bins don't displace from their respective spots as they are placed inside
                    holes.
                    <br />
                    • The mosquitoes which accumulated due to the stagnant water in the dustbins will
                    come down to 0.
                    <br />
                    • There will be ease of use and people will easily be able to throw the garbage
                    without facing the difficulties they faced.<br />
                    • The dustbins will be placed intact and will not fall down as the existing system.
                    <br />
                    • The smell will be lowered down that comes out of the dustbins by the use of epoxy
                    resins.
                    <br />
                    • The traditional iron dustbins will be replaced by the hard PVC dustbins which
                    would not rust and will be lighter in weight.
                    <br />
                    • The stray animals will not be able to get into the dustbins which would prevent
                    several diseases that are caused to them.
                    <br />
                    • They will be environment friendly.

                    I. PROPOSED SYSTEM The proposed system is the new design of the dustbins and it
                    will cover all the problems which are faced by the people. The basic structure of
                    the dustbins will be of the inverted trapezoid. The inverted trapezoid is chosen
                    because the surface area is larger at the bigger end and it can hold more garbage
                    than the cube and cuboidal bins. The inverted bin will be covered with a hemisphere
                    which will cover one side of the dustbin such that if someone even aims into the
                    dustbins than it doesn’t fall off from the other end. The height of the dustbins
                    can’t be trimmed but to make the dustbins feasible they can be placed up to 2-2.5ft.
                    in the ground. They can be still emptied and lifted by the fork lifter trucks. The
                    concrete walls of the ground will prevent the moisture and damage to the dustbins.
                    A rubber ring will be placed on the top such that there is no direct contact of
                    the dustbins with the ground and placing rubber ring will also ensure that during
                    the emptying of the dustbins the walls are intact and are not damaged and the dustbins
                    will also be in intact shape. The proposed rubber ring will also provide the seal
                    which would not allow the rain water to enter below the bins. The hemisphere covers
                    on the dustbins will not let the rain water to stagnate in bins. The smell that
                    comes out of the dustbins will also be reduced by the lid. The lid will be detachable
                    so that while the garbage collection the lid can be removed and the garbage can
                    be easily loaded into the trucks for dumping. The foul smells that comes out of
                    the dustbins can be lowered by using epoxy resins and the dustbins inner walls will
                    be painted will Hydrophobic paints so that nothing sticks on the wall of the container.
                    The trucks are fitted with the The sensors are attached to the dustbin to check
                    when the dustbin is full and the signal is sent when the dustbin is at 75% capacity
                    to consider the time of commute by the collection trucks and routing. Raspberry
                    pie is used to create the circuit. The photosensor is used to maintain the circuit
                    closed between the laser and the senor. As the garbage falls, the circuit is broken
                    and the timer of 100 seconds start. If the circuit is restored then the timer stops.
                    If the circuit does not get closed even after 100 seconds then the RF transceiver
                    is started. The status signal of the dustbin is sent along with the dustbin ID.
                    As the transceiver transmits the signal, the whole sensor system goes in battery
                    saver mode, until the dustbin is emptied. The sensor uses rechargeable battery which
                    theoretically should last for a month. The Existing dustbins do not have any sensors
                    and are neither connected through anyways to the base stations. The Proposed system
                    provides the connection to each and every dustbin. To provide the connections to
                    each and every dustbin we are using the radio frequency[3] waves. The system is
                    based on the GoTenna technology developed in U.S. for SOS services. It uses the
                    unlicensed frequency bandwidth to transmit the information from the user device
                    to the base stations. The TCP/IP protocol and OSPF are being used for transmitting
                    and securing the data. The radio frequency transceiver will transmit outboard messages
                    to the base stations. The location of the dustbins will be pre-stored at the base
                    station and every dustbin will get a unique id along with the location co-ordinated.
                    The signal is sent on unlicensed Radio spectrum[1]. The unlicensed low frequency
                    bandwidth available in India is 865MHz to 867MHz. The purpose of using low frequency
                    bandwidth is that they don’t interfere with the Mobile communication and other bandwidth.
                    The Transceiver is connected to the Raspberry pie and an antenna allows the transmission
                    of the signal. The battery of the transceiver in theories should last for 15-20
                    days. The signal includes the unique ID of the dustbin. As the signal reaches the
                    base station, The ID is recorded in the table and then routing algorithm is applied.
                    Process flow diagram for sending signal The base station receives the ID’s pulls
                    out the location of the dustbins by ID. The location co-ordinates then are mapped
                    and shortest path[2] calculation is used. Firstly, convex hull is used to map the
                    outline and give the approximate distance to each destination and Dijkstra’s algorithm
                    is used to find the distance keeping the starting location as the base station then
                    the shortest path which connected to all the dustbins which are full are calculated
                    and the path is followed. This optimized route saves fuel and also increases the
                    efficiency of the system. From the statistics the system can further predict where
                    the demand is more and where it is less and thus leading to more effective routing.

                    • The design of municipal bins that are used for Garbage collection have not changed
                    in past 15 years.
                    <br />
                    • The Garbage collection method has been the same.<br />
                    • The bins used are not up to the population demand and the waste thrown by them,
                    which leads to the overflowing garbage.
                    <br />
                    Issues faced by the people are often overlooked. Some of the issues are-
                    <br />
                    The height of the dustbins that makes people vulnerable to throwing heavy garbage
                    bags into the bins.
                    <br />
                    • The typical smell that comes from the dustbins.
                    <br />
                    • In rains the dustbins are filled with water, making them breeding grounds for
                    mosquitoes.
                    <br />
                    The bins that are used are made from iron which makes them vulnerable to rusting.
                    <br />
                    • Iron gets degraded due to biological actions that occurs in the waste.<br />
                    • The dustbins used are open which let all the fowl smells out from the dustbins.
                    <br />
                    • The height of the dustbins are close to 5 feet and the average height of Indian
                    people is(Source: Imperial College London) are 5feet 4 inches, and the open structure
                    of dustbins makes it hard for the people to throw the garbage due to fowl smells
                    and the height of the dustbins.
                    <br />
                    • People try to aim the garbage bags into the bins because of the smell and the
                    stray animals standing nearby which don’t allow people to reach nearby.

                    Abstract- As the technology keeps improving drastically the customer's requirement
                    increases day by day, mainly on mobile devices. In this paper we are trying to explain
                    the importance of Location Based system, as by the medium of shopping. Online shopping
                    is done by everyone in this world but that’s time consuming. So, we proposed a smart
                    location based smart shopping application for android devices. With the help of
                    GPS and the application it can be implemented. The offers and discount running around
                    the mall or shops will be available as the notifications on user’s device as soon
                    as user enters the shop. The location information in shopping application (SAGO)is
                    produced by the Geo-Position of the user's device. The use of application is that
                    a user searches a product, then the SAGO identifies the location and searches for
                    it in the closest stores and mall and the online payment can be done for the products
                    listed on the application and user then can directly go to the store and collect
                    the item. By this a area of 2-4 Km can be covered and be searched for the products.
                    As there is Location based system through maps also we can look for the store as
                    well as the products and make online payment by which shopping will be easy and
                    within less time we have to just go and pick up the product.

                    Introduction- On Smart phones and mobile devices the technology keeps on increasing,
                    the idea of handsets is to deliver valuable and effective services. In the past
                    few years, Location based systems have become for wide-ranging applications such
                    as navigation and monitoring. In recent years, the shopping experience and trends
                    have changed a lot that too drastically .In this paper we are trying to explain
                    the importance of location based application as by the medium of Smart shopping
                    application .As the online shopping is quiet common and we get variety of things
                    in it but it is time consuming , as we search, wait for the product to come etc.
                    so we have the idea of Smart shopping application using location based services
                    and GPS it can be implemented. The main motive or use of the application is that
                    user searches a product and through location the application searches the product
                    in the nearest store or malls as such. As in fact there is also a medium of online
                    payment which will be implemented. The user just has to buy the product online and
                    just have to go to collect the product this is how it works. Also shop owner can
                    add, delete, update, modify the items. It shows the deals, discounts, offers entered
                    by the shopkeeper. LBS or location-based services is referred to a set of applications
                    that exploit the position of mobile device to give information. Location-based services
                    (LBS) provide the clients with services according to their location as such. A new
                    area for the developers and the network operators to implement the value addedservices
                    by the service providers E.g. providing routing information, traffic status and
                    at last finding the mall and the shop. Therefore, location-based services have certain
                    merits on the clients of mobile users as:
                    <br />
                    - 1.Receiving the location of lost<br />
                    2.To get the location of and Banks, Hotels, and other services.
                    <br />
                    3.Receive alerts and notifications for the Traffic jams and Shopping alerts. Location
                    based Services can be distinguish in 3 categories<br />
                    a) Consumer Services - These are the sets of the location-based applications which
                    does help in accessing the multiple services such as Map Navigation. As we get the
                    location of two places. Advertising as such in shopping mall near to your location.
                    <br />
                    b) Emergency Services- During emergency the location of the mobile client can be
                    traced or we have different hazards to get the location
                    <br />
                    c) Preferred Location Search- As by the terms preferred it also searches of ATM
                    and Restaurants but within a given boundary such as 5 to 15 kms range from the current
                    location. To track the position of the mobile the accuracy of the positioning methods
                    in real time is taken by the approach used as Location can be represented by text
                    descriptions or spatial location.<br />
                    A spatial location consists of latitudelongitude- altitude coordinate system. Altitude
                    is taken as meters above sea level and longitude as 0-180 degrees and latitude as
                    0-90 degrees north or south. The current location of the mobile client can be retrieved
                    by-<br />
                    1) Satellites.
                    <br />
                    2) Mobile Phone Service Provider Network. The new technology that integrates the
                    mobile network with the GPS is the Assisted-GPS. This is there to give a accuracy
                    of 5 to 10 meters. Within a second the problem is being fixed, has better coverage
                    in some cases, as it requires few satellites and less consumption of energy. The
                    disadvantage is cost of AGPS enabled handsets for the user.

                    4. Proposed system In this system, the user will search the item which you want
                    to purchase with the help of the app. Now unlike the old system the app now also
                    gives pop-up notification for all the discounts and deals. Immediately whenever
                    we enter the mall we get all the details of every shop and it highlights all the
                    offers going on around. The proposed system works on location-based services. The
                    system has two sides- the client side And the server side. The client-side works
                    on the front end. The client side allows user to register for the app so that the
                    app can access the location of the user and they can search for products. It will
                    also show offers and discounts on the screen that can be availed from the shop.
                    Also from the client side, the customer can choose checkout and pay online or else
                    the user can directly go to the shop and buy their product. The server side is the
                    back end of the app or the side that is controlled by the shop owner. The shop owner
                    has a separate registration option. Once the owner has registered in the app, they
                    can add the current deals and offer going on in the particular shop which will be
                    displayed on the customer side. The location services is a method to detect your
                    current location and all the stores near you to show all the discount offers going
                    around. In our proposed system we can not only view a particular product but also
                    add them to cart for a faster checkout. Our system also includes the ease to do
                    payments through online payment gateways for faster check out process. The use of
                    web services is a must for our system. The web service is a method of communication
                    between two electronics devices over a network. As the connection is established,
                    the user is now connected with the database and information related to that item
                    is provided to him. In this whole procedure the overall time of searching of individual
                    products is saved and thus reducing the time of the shopping.

                    6. Algorithms A. Agglomerative algorithm The agglomerative algorithm is mainly used
                    for clustering the results. It is a “bottom-up approach, pair of objects or clusters
                    are merged as they come up in hierarchy. Traditional hierarchical algorithms use
                    similarity, proximity matrix. Operations carried out-
                    <br />
                    1. The similar products are grouped using their prices that are mentioned on them.
                    <br />
                    2. The output of the first is the input for this operation, and it is the normalization
                    process
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Xprice Normalizaton(Xprice) = MAXprice Xprice = Representative price of the product
                    metioned MAXPrice = Selected price from the product result list Price of products
                    is scaled between 0 and 1.<br />
                    <br />
                    This is needed for presenting the products in a two dimension coordinate system
                    and also the total calculation time is low. B. Greedy Search Algorithm The greedy
                    algorithm is used for removing the unrelated information from the data. The products
                    are filtered as they come from the internet resources. The algorithm is modified
                    according to the mobile application’s requirements. C. Smart Filtering Algorithm
                    The application uses clustering approach to help the smart filtering to search products
                    details on the application easily. The algorithm takes the text as the input and
                    the processed texts or filtered texts as output. The common processing operations
                    are-  Common strings or words are removed using a list of stop words.  Uppercase
                    letters are transformed to lowercase letters.  Special symbols are removed and
                    sequences of multiple spaces are reduced to one space gap.  Numbers and dates are
                    further transformed into a standard format.  The suffixes and prefixes are removed
                    from the keywords. Compute the distance/proximity matrix between the input data
                    points, if necessary. Let each data point be a cluster Repeat Merge the closest
                    two clusters Update the distance/proximity matrix Until Only one cluster remains
                     Automatic keyword extraction for accurate search results  Word ranking. D. IR2
                    Tree The current systems search the location on the basis of their geometric locations.
                    We in this application are going to use the existing the GPS services. The malls
                    and shops marked on the map will be reflected in the list format in the application
                    according to the location. As the user enters the mall, the application will access
                    the location and display the deals and discount according to that location and gives
                    the notification to the user.

                    IMPLEMENTATION This location-based application uses the input in the form of the
                    user location. Location based service is another key feature of the smart phone
                    applications. This app combines with the Maps installed on the system device to
                    get the efficient and accurate location. This application works on android and the
                    API versions above 6.0. The application requires and requests the periodic update
                    of the location of the user. The application on installing asks for permission to
                    access the user location. The application can also register a intent receiver for
                    proximity alerts – Basically when the customer enter and exited from an area of
                    given latitude and longitude radius.  Creation of user account and client account.
                     Adding and editing of tasks  Storing the information and tasks in the SQLite
                    database  Tracking the location and displaying it  Viewing the deals and discount
                    as notification  Displaying the products listed by clients on the application 
                    Providing a payment mode to buy products on app itself  Retrieving the information
                    on the mobile device A. Service Supplication The service application running in
                    background will track the user location continuously. Android Software Development
                    kit (SDK) does not provide a special intent that can notice the change in the location.
                    For location detection we use Broadcast receiver – BOOT_COMPLETED event. Therefore,
                    as once the device is booted on the location services is supplied automatically
                    using the app’s service routine. Permission has to be set in the android manifest
                    file. There are further division of classes of division in location API package
                    to retrieve the location information from the user.  LocationManager- This class
                    provides access to the location services as well as provides facility to get the
                    best location provider as per the Criteria.  LocationListner- It provides the callback
                    methods which are provided when the location is changed. The listener object is
                    registered within the location manager class.  LocationProvider- It’s an abstract
                    super class for location providers. A location provides the periodic information
                    of the geographic location of the device.  Criteria – It provides the application
                    choose the suitable location provider by providing access to set of required properties
                    of the Location Provider. In this application we will use the API provided by google
                    maps. With the help of the google maps we can provide the device’s more accurate
                    information and it Google maps API also gives the notification to the customer about
                    the mall they entered and provide with the internal map of the map .This will help
                    us to optimize our application and work it more efficiently. B. Database The application’s
                    task data is stored in the SQLite database. This can be viewed by using the third-party
                    browser while running the program. The database will store the following information
                    within it.  A table will store all the information about the customer which will
                    include their NAME, MOBILE NUMBER, DATE OF BIRTH, E-MAIL ID, COUNTRY, STATE, CITY,
                    PINCODE.  Another table will contain all the data of the shops and outlets in the
                    mall. This table will store their SHOP/OUTLET NAME, PASSWORD, ADDRESS, NAME OF MALL,
                    LOCATION (it will be fixed),CONTACT NUMBER,GSTIN NUMBER,PAN NUMBER.  The deals
                    and discount provided by the clients are stored in another table which has fields
                    like category, type , price range , percentage of discount , validity of the discount
                    , clock timer , products(optional) on discount, brands , terms and conditions ,
                    images2 , image of the product , price of the product , acceptance of payment mode
                    . This table is directly connected to the homepage of the application and the information
                    stored here will be displayed there in the proper alignment and proper presentation
                    elements. The latitude and longitudes of the customers as well as the clients are
                    stored in the backend of the MySQL backend. C. Deals and discount Information Retailers
                    can publish the information about the deals and discounts directly through the app
                    provided to them and logging in to their accounts. They can add the deals and discounts
                    and update It according to their needs. The images, percentage, The amount of discount
                    can be posted through the app. The type form kind of outlet will facilitate the
                    retailers and make it at their ease to publish the data. They will also be able
                    to list their products in case they have the sale on certain products. They can
                    update the photo, descriptions and label of the products, with the MAX price as
                    well as the discounted price. The discount percentage and the difference will be
                    calculated directly be the application and displayed to the customers.

                    PROTOTYPE MODEL A prototype is an early approximation of a final system or product.
                    It is a system development method as it can be reworked, build and tested. Until
                    a complete prototype is built and developed as acceptable to the system. It is a
                    trial-and error process that takes place between two, as developers and users. This
                    prototype should be as the final review after the product is developed and acceptable.
